# gitspoof
A demonstrational tool to get people to appear in your contributors list.

### Disclaimer

### How it works
Once installed, you can do `gitspoof --help` to see the args. 
`--repo` is the path to the repository, `--name` is the display name of the person you want to spoof, and 
`--email` is the email of the person you are trying to spoof - **GitHub uses the email when checking commits against accounts, so this is the most important parameter**, and 
`--message` is the commit name/message.
